## Mojavesoft Group
This is the organization that hosts and maintains software from [Mojavesoft](https://mojavesoft.net), as well as various interesting experiments.

### Jameson development
One of the most important projects maintained by the Mojavesoft Group is _Jameson_. Jameson is an experimental programming language that takes inspiration from TurboWarp and Snap!.

In January 2026, we created the Jameson Team to help integrate Jameson with other products and provide new libraries.
